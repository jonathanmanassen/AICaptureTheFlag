# AI Movement

AI Movement is a unity 3D project testing different ai movement behaviours in video game with a capture the flag game and a test scene where you can play with the different behaviours by enabling the one you want.

## Build the game

If you need to build the game, open the project in unity (preferably version 2018.2.x or more advanced). go into file, build settings, make sure the menu scene is in build as the first scene, the testMovement one as the second, the CTF scene third and the randomCTF as 4th.

## Getting Started

To start the game, launch COMP 476.exe in the build directory, choose your desired resolution and press play. Once in the main menu, press play game, and the game will start.

## Controls

The controls for the test scene should be displayed on screen.
